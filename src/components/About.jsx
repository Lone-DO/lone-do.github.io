        I graduated from Eastern High as an Honors Student, (A technology-based
        school) where I got my first steps into computer science. Both during
        and after graduation, I was building up my career into IT as an
        adaptable craftsman with 5 yrs as a Carpenter & 2 yrs catering around
        Louisville.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, a programming school was funded by the government to help
        accelerate new developers into the local workforce called Code
        Louisville, a school I hold dear to as it exposed my passion for
        technology. From here I graduated as a Front End/ Full Stack Developer
        with the fundamentals of Software Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Git, with Frameworks/ libraries such as Angular.js, Ember.js, Node.js
        and more). I used these relentlessly on side projects such as my
        portfolio and many other side projects while staying up to date. Soon
        after, I was hired on as an IT for Norton Children's Hospital, where my
        skillset expanded learning how to manage networks, helpdesk, imaging
        systems, setting up systems for Doctors, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the contract at Norton was complete, I was hired by Asurion to
        work as a traveling Technical Consultant for the Louisville district
        Sprint stores. Here I consulted with clients to provide solutions based
        on their needs, usually related to devices, sometimes it leads to doing
        repairs & assisting with insurance claims. We would have weekly meetings
        with the district team, sort of like Scrums where we discussed and
        exchanged details to improve customer experiences. I'd built a widget
        for the team to help with our daily procedures, including ways to track
        interactions for callbacks, notes, and checklist using Excel/VBA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I Eventually left Asurion to live abroad with my family in Germany for
        some time. Throughout these years I was consulting with a gaming
        community called Merq Squad. Together we built a website in WordPress,
        which eventually was developed using Vanilla code. I also provided
        helpdesk support for the community in between teaching code to the
        administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2019, I've been working as an Administrator at Ceva, where I
        overlook tasks related to Operations. Which includes files/data
        management, inventory, financing, IT, and designing. I build widgets in
        VBA for HR/Administrators while providing technical support.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a Full-time programmer, where I can spend my days
        developing applications of various scales. It is the urge of the
        foreboding challenge that intrigues me, it's a world I've been able to
        integrate throughout my journey, but not enough to be satisfied. I'm
        adaptable to any situation, feel free to contact me if you need a
        candidate that can learn fast & is passionate about their work.
